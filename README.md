# Dialogflow CX reference connection code

You can use the Dialogflow CX (DF CX) reference connection code to connect a Vonage Voice API call to a DF CX agent and then have an audio conversation with the agent. Caller's queries and agent's responses transcripts are posted back to the Vonage Voice API application.

## About this reference connection code

Dialogflow CX reference connection makes use of the [WebSockets feature](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/concepts/websockets) of Vonage Voice API. When a voice call is established, a Voice API application triggers a WebSocket connection to this Dialogflow reference connection and streams the audio to and from the voice call in real time.

See https://github.com/nexmo-se/dialogflow-cx-sample-voice-application for a **sample Voice API application** using this Dialogflow CX reference connection code to connect voice calls to a DF CX agent.

## Transcripts

This reference connection code will send caller's speech transcript, and Dialogflow agent's response transcript to the Voice API application via webhook calls.

## Enabling APIs on your Google project

Using your Google Cloud Console, on your corresponding Google project, make sure that the **Dialogflow API** is enabled.

## Dialogflow agent

You may already have a DF CX agent ready, if not, please create one that will be used for the purpose here.

For the next sections, we will need:
- (a) the corresponding Google Cloud Project ID,</br>
- (b) the Google Application Credentials JSON file (actual credentials file name has ".json" extension),</br>
- (c) the Dialogflow CX agent location,</br>
- and (d) the Dialogflow CX agent ID.</br></br>

- To retrieve the Google Cloud Project ID:</br>
Go to https://console.cloud.google.com, select the relevant project, under Project info section, you will see the Project ID, we will use that value to set the parameter **GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID** in the next sections,</br></br>

- To retrieve the application credentials:</br>
click on the top left corner (3-vertical bars named Navigation Menu)</br>
select APIs Services > Credentials</br>
click on [+ CREATE CREDENTIALS] Service account</br>
enter a name for 'Service account name' , e.g. *VonageDFCX*</br>
click [CREATE AND CONTINUE]</br>
under Select a role dropdown menu, select Owner (note: role permissions are outside the scope of this README)</br>
click [CONTINUE]</br>
click [DONE]</br>
click on the service account you just created</br>
click on [KEYS]</br>
click on [ADD KEY] Create new key</br>
select JSON as key type</br>
click on CREATE</br>
save that key file (ending with .json) on your computer and add a leading dot to the filename (e.g. .xxxx.json), it will need to be copied to this application folder once installed from this repository</br>
that key file name is the value, e.g. *.VonageDFCX-05768e59b7c5.json*,  
we will use that value to set the parameter **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS** in the next sections.</br></br>

- To retrieve the Dialogflow CX agent location:</br>
Go to https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/cx, select the relevant project</br>
on the line showing your DF CX agent, the region name is displayed, e.g. *us-west1*</br>
we will use that value to set the parameter **DF_AGENT_LOCATION** in the next sections.</br></br>

- To retrieve the Dialogflow CX agent ID:</br>
on the line showing your DF CX agent, click on the 3-vertical dots,</br>
click on Copy name</br>
the last part of that character string after *agents/* is the agent ID</br>
e.g. *7b2598cf-9ed7-414e-8b6f-c1bf8f5dabf5*</br>
we will use that value to set the parameter **DF_AGENT_ID** in the next sections.</br></br>

## Running Dialogflow reference connection code

You deploy the Dialogflow reference connection code in one of the following couple of ways.

### Local deployment

#### Ngrok

[Download and install ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download), an Internet tunelling service.</br>
Sign in or sign up with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), from the menu, follow the **Setup and Installation** guide.

Set up a domain to forward to the local port 6000 (as this server application will be listening on port 6000).

Start ngrok to listen on port 6000,</br>
please take note of the ngrok **Enpoint URL** as it is needed when setting up the corresponding [sample server application](https://github.com/nexmo-se/dialogflow-cx-sample-voice-application) using Vonage Voice API,
that URL looks like:</br>
`https://yyyyyyyy.ngrok.io`

#### Node.js - Application

To run your own instance of this sample application locally, you'll need Node.js (we tested with version 18.19).

Download this sample application code to a local folder, then go to that folder.

Copy the `.env.example` file over to a new file called `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` file, and set the first 4 parameter values:</br>
GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID=xxxxxx </br>
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.json</br>
DF_AGENT_LOCATION=xxxxxx<br>
DF_AGENT_ID=xxxxxxxxx<br>
DF_LANGUAGE=en<br>

You may change the DF_LANGUAGE parameter value depending on your DF CX agent's language.


Install dependencies once:
```bash
npm install
```

Launch the applicatiom:
```bash
node df-cx-connecting-server
```

### Command Line Heroku deployment

You must first have deployed your application locally, as explained in previous section, and verified it is working.

Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Install [Heroku command line](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/command-line) and login to your Heroku account.

If you do not yet have a local git repository, create one:</br>
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -am "initial"
```

Start by creating this application on Heroku from the command line using the Heroku CLI:

```bash
heroku create myappname
```

Note: In above command, replace "myappname" with a unique name on the whole Heroku platform.

On your Heroku dashboard where your application page is shown, click on `Settings` button,
add the following `Config Vars` and set them with their respective values:</br>
GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID</br>
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS</br>
DF_AGENT_LOCATION<br>
DF_AGENT_ID<br>
DF_LANGUAGE<br>


Deploy the application:

```bash
git push heroku master
```
